**Course & Year:** BSIT-3

**Short Description about yourself:**
I am a student at CIT-U and aspiring to be a game developer or a software engineer. 
I try to do my best doing the things I love with the skills that I have.
I usually spend my time learning new technologies, improving my coding skills, and working on personal projects.
I enjoy developing backend systems, working with databases, and exploring game development. 
Collaborating with others on projects helps me grow both as a developer and a team player. 
I aim to create meaningful software that solves real-world problems while also pursuing my passion for game development.
