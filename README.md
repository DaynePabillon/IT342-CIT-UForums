<Short Description about yourself()>
  I am a student at CIT-U and aspiring to be a game developer or a software engineer. 
  I try to do my best doing the things I love with the skills that I have.
  I usually spend my time learning new technologies, improving my coding skills, and working on personal projects.
  I enjoy developing backend systems, working with databases, and exploring game development.
  Collaborating with others on projects helps me grow both as a developer and a team player.
  I aim to create meaningful software that solves real-world problems while also pursuing my passion for game development.
